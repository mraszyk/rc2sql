# RC2SQL

RC2SQL is a tool for translating relational calculus (RC) queries to SQL.
RC2SQL takes as input a RC query and a training database
and outputs a pair of RANF queries:
- one characterizing the query's relative safety
- and one equivalent to the original query if it is relatively safe.

The training database is only used by heuristics in the query translation
to approximate the time complexity of query evaluation over the actual database.
The choice of the training database does NOT impact the translation's correctness.

VGTrans is our implementation of the translation by Van Gelder & Topor.
VGTrans has the same interface as RC2SQL.

This repository is the supplementary material for Martin Raszyk's PhD thesis.

# Build

We recommend running the experiments using `docker` and the provided `Dockerfile`.
Please set up at least 8 GiB of main memory for your Docker container.
Note that the first command below will take some time to finish.
```
sudo docker build --platform linux/amd64 --no-cache -t rc2sql .
sudo docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it rc2sql
```
Once you run the second command above you will
obtain a shell with all the tools installed.

We observed that several queries (e.g., the 2nd query in the MEDIUM experiment) time out
if the setting `enable_nestloop = off` is omitted in the PostgreSQL configuration.
Hence, we set `enable_nestloop = off` in all our experiments (l. 70 in Dockerfile).

# Usage

To evaluate a RC query using RC2SQL and a database engine `${db}` type:

```

$ ./eval_${db}.sh ${prefix}

```

where

prefix = prefix of the path to a text file with a RC query (`${prefix}.fo`),
a training database (`${prefix}.tdb`), and the actual database (`${prefix}.db`).

To run our translation RC2SQL (without evaluating the query on an actual database) type:

```

$ ./src/rtrans.native ${prefix}

```

and to run the translation VGTrans (without evaluating the query on an actual database) type:

```
$ ./src/vgtrans.native ${prefix}
```

where

prefix = prefix of the path to a text file with a RC query (`${prefix}.fo`)
and a training database (`${prefix}.tdb`).

RC2SQL outputs a pair of queries (`${prefix}.afin`, `${prefix}.ainf`) using
the optimizations and a pair of queries (`${prefix}.sfin`, `${prefix}.sinf`)
without optimizations.

VGTrans outputs the queries `${prefix}.v{afin, ainf, sfin, sinf}`.

RC Syntax

```
{f} ::=   TRUE
        | FALSE
        | {ID}({s})
        | {ID} = {t}
        | NOT {f}
        | {f} AND {f}
        | {f} OR  {f}
        | {f} IMPLIES {f}
        | EXISTS {ID} . {f}
        | FORALL {ID} . {f}

{t} ::=   {NUM}
        | {ID}

{s} ::=   %empty
        | {t}
        | {t} , {s}
```

where `{NUM}` is a nonnegative integer (constant)
and `{ID}` is an identifier (variable) consisting
of alphanumeric characters.
Non-terminals are enclosed in curly braces.

Database Syntax

```
{d} :=    %empty
        | {ID}({s}) {d}

{s} ::=   %empty
        | {NUM}
        | {NUM} , {s}
```

where `{NUM}` is a nonnegative integer
and `{ID}` is an identifier (atomic predicate).

# Example

An example is provided in the script `examples/ex.sh`.

A warning of the form `NOTICE:  table "tbl_*" does not exist, skipping`
is produced when the table `tbl_*` is dropped, but does not exist.
It is not an error and can safely be ignored.

The script contains example invocations of all the tools used in the artifact.

The script creates a random query using the tool `./tools/gen_test`. (You can invoke the tool without any arguments to display its usage.)
Then the script translates the query to RANF queries using the RC2SQL and VGTrans tools and then to SQL using the *radb* tool. It creates both optimized and unoptimized translations.

Then it sets up PostgreSQL and MySQL databases to contain an example database and evaluates the queries using Verimon, PostgreSQL, MySQL, tool by Ailamazyan et al, DDDs, LDDs, and MonPoly-Reg.
Results of the evaluation using all tools are then compared to the expected result provided by the Ailamazyan et al.'s tool (hence the "OK"s in the output).

Finally the script computes the cost of each translated query using the `cnt.py` script.
Hence, it produces output of the form:

```
 cost
------
 8660
(1 row)

 cost
------
    1
(1 row)

cost
8660
cost
1
```

We remark that a query evaluation's time can be influenced by other queries,
e.g., the one computing the query cost, that are evaluated before
if the database is not reinitialized (all relevant tables dropped and reloaded).
Hence, we reinitialize the relevant tables (i.e., those appearing in a query)
in the database before every query evaluation in our experiments.

# Evaluation

To reproduce the experiments from the paper, run

```
$ ./amazon.sh
$ ./run.sh
```

The individual experiments are described in Section 4.2.7.
We choose the first ten seeds for all experiments except the experiment INFINITE,
where we choose the first five seeds that yield different queries
even after renaming variables and permuting terms in atomic predicates,
whose evaluation results are not too large,
and that yield finite and infinite results
for the two Data Golf strategies, respectively.
After the script `run.sh` finishes,
the results are contained in the files `exps_*.tex`
used to plot Figure 4.5 and 4.6.

A PDF with the evaluation results can be obtained by executing
```
$ ./bold.sh
$ pdflatex main.tex
```

The timeout for the individual experiments can be set
in the scripts `exps_*.sh`. With the unmodified timeouts of 200s and 400s, respectively,
the script would take roughly 8 hours to recreate the tables.

Note. If you want to run the benchmarks with a tool
that is omitted in the paper because the tool always times out or crashes,
please uncomment the corresponding line in the script `exps_*.sh`, e.g.,
to execute LDDs in the experiment MEDIUM, uncomment the following line
```
#line "\\ldd" run04LDD
```
in the script `exps_medium.sh`.

# Query Cost

To confirm that the count aggregations optimize the inefficiency of VGT\-
compared to RC2SQL\-, we compute the query cost for Q^{susp} on a Data Golf structure
with `n = 20`. We choose this size of the Data Golf structure
to be able to compute the query cost within a reasonable time.
Note that the queries `*inf` are FALSE for Q^{susp} and can thus be neglected in terms of their cost.

```
$ ./amazon/gen_test "/home/rcsql/z_0" 1 0 20 2 1 0
$ ./src/rtrans.native z_0
$ ./src/vgtrans.native z_0
$ ./radb.sh z_0
$ psql < z_0.psql
$ python3 cnt.py z_0.asqlfin | psql     # cost of RC2SQL
 cost
------
 3287
(1 row)

$ python3 cnt.py z_0.ssqlfin | psql     # cost of RC2SQL-
  cost  
--------
 116140
(1 row)

$ python3 cnt.py z_0.vasqlfin | psql    # cost of VGT
 cost

(1 row)

$ python3 cnt.py z_0.vssqlfin | psql    # cost of VGT-

# Comparing query normal forms

Folder `nf/` contains empirical results of our comparison of safe-range normal form (SRNF) and existential normal form (ENF).

These results support our observations in Example 2.18.

Furthermore, the folder `nf/` contains an empirical comparison of `LEFT JOIN` vs `EXCEPT`.

Please refer to the `README.md` file in the folder `nf/` for more details.

# Unsound results produced by MySQL

Running `for i in {0..9}; do ./test_ranf.sh 14 4 2 1 10 2 1 ${i}; done`
tests the translation of the queries used in the SMALL experiment
from RANF to SQL by comparing PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and VeriMon
(which is verified and thus its output is guaranteed to be correct).
Here we use `n = 10` as the script `test_ranf.sh` cannot be used with a higher value of the parameter `n`.

The output (in the file `log.txt`)
```
RE: /home/rcsql/z_14_4_2_1_10_2_1_1/am

```
reports 10 inconsistencies between MySQL and PostgreSQL.
The verdict `DIFF` stands for unsound output while `RE` denotes a runtime error.
For instance, the first line reports a runtime error in MySQL (suffix `m`)
on the optimized query (prefix `a`).
`DIFF(p-m)` denotes an output inconsistency between PostgreSQL and MySQL.
`DIFF(p-*.l)` denotes an output inconsistency between PostgreSQL and SQLite.
`DIFF(p-v)` denotes an output inconsistency between PostgreSQL and VeriMon.
`DIFF(v-v)` denotes an output inconsistency between optimized and unoptimized RANF queries.
`DIFF(dg)` denotes a violation of Data Golf properties (positive set is not contained
in the result or negative set has nonempty intersection with the result)

Note. We remark that the output of MySQL can be nondeterministic, i.e.,
some of the above inconsistencies might not be reported at every execution
of `test_ranf.sh`.

# Tests

To test RC2SQL/VGTrans against the formally verified implementation
of the approach by Ailamazyan et al. run

```
$ ./test_all.sh
```

In total, 40 tests are executed (they take roughly 5 minutes to finish).
The errors are printed into `log.txt` (the file does not exist if no error
has been found).
The tests are conducted on pseudorandom queries and databases.
The parameters are summarized here and can be easily adjusted in the file
`test_all.sh`.

- Number of subqueries: 10
- Maximum arity of a subquery: 4
- Precise arity of the query: 2
- Free variables must be *generated*: 0/1
- Minimum number of tuples in a table: 4
- Minimum number of tuples in a training table: 2
- Data Golf strategy: 0/1
