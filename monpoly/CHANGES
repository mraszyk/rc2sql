Version 1.1.7
-------------
- Simplified and extented output for non-monitorable formulas.
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.6
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.5
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.4
-------------
- Syntax change: Variables do not need to be prefix by the ? symbol.
  (For the syntax of aggregations, see the formulas in the
  experiments/policies directory.)
- Note: In comparison to the FMSD submission, the trigger operator is
  not supported, and the past always operator is treated as sytactic
  sugar for NEG ONCE NEG. 
- Support for the MED ("median") aggregation operator.  
- Support for floating point numbers.
- AVG return a floting point number, not an integer.
- New function symbols: MOD, and the type convertors f2i and i2f.

Version 1.1.3
-------------
- extension to aggregation operators and function symbols; limitations: 
  - aggregation only on variables and not on arbitrary terms
  - only arithmetic functions
  - average returns an integer, not a float
  - rudimentary type checking 
  - some rules (e.g. RIG_{\land\neg}) are not implemented yet

Version 1.1.2
-------------
- Performance improvement in the evaluation of subformulas of the form
phi AND psi, where the free variables of phi form a subset of the
free variables of psi.

- An accompanying translation from MFOTL formulas to SQL queries.

Version 1.1.1
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.0
-------------
- Implemented two log filters which filter tuples and empty time
  points based on the input formula

- Implemented a new algorithm to incrementally compute the satisfying
  tuples for temporal subformulas (see the Sliding module)

- Relation.minus is now computed as an anti-join instead of a
  equi-join followed by a set difference.

- Improvement in computing the satisfying tuples for some temporal
  subformulas, by merging time-points with equal time-stamps.

- Signature files should now contain both variable names and
  corresponding types.

- Saving and loading the monitor state currently disabled.

- Minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Minor bug fix.

- Added an example (the more complex policy from the RV'11 tool
  paper).

- Empty relations accepted in the log files.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
First release.
